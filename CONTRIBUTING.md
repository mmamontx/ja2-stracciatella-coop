All the original JA2S [ideas](https://github.com/ja2-stracciatella/ja2-stracciatella/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) remain valid. The scope of this particular project is limited to cooperative multiplayer on top of JA2-Stracciatella - all the rest goes to the original repository. The changes leverage JA2S design and are implemented on top of its ideas. They strive to be lean by continuously reviewing and progressively minimizing the code.

At the moment I am developing this alone. To get in touch with me you can use the [mail](mailto:mmamontx@gmail.com).
